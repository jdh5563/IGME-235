                <h2 id="bioheading">About Me</h2>
                <p id="bio">I am a second year student at RIT majoring in Game Design and Development. My whole life I
                    have
                    always had a special passion for mathematics and later into my teen years I gained an appreciation
                    for
                    programming.
                    When I think about where I am five to ten years in the future, I can see a multitude of outcomes.
                    Something
                    that I have been able to narrow down, however, is what I want to do when I graduate. Realistically I
                    know
                    I want to do some kind of mathematics-based programming, which leads me towards graphics programming
                    either
                    for video games or for computer hardware, like a GPU. Until then, I am going to enjoy my time in
                    college
                    at
                    RIT, learning and experiencing new things and having fun with my passions.

                    <h2><a href="asteroids-v1/index.html">Asteroids</a></h2>
                    <p>This is a recreation of the classic arcade game Asteroids. In this game, you play
                        as a spaceship attempting to navigate through endless clusters of asteroids, blasting
                        any that get in your way as you rack up points with each successful hit. The goal of
                        the game is to score as many points as possible before running out of lives. In the
                        event that all lives are lost, the game ends and your highscore is saved. The theme 
                        of my version of the game is designed to replicate the retro feeling of the basic vector 
                        graphics used in the game when it was originally created.
