        <h1>Gear Shifter Project Proposal</h1>
    </header>

    <h2>High Concept</h2>
    <p>Gear Shifter is a racing game where the user
        will race against an AI around a racetrack
        trying to be the first one across the finish
        line.
    </p>

    <h2>Genre</h2>
    <p>Gear Shifter is a Racing game.</p>

    <h2>Platform</h2>
    <p>Gear Shifter is designed to be for desktop only,
        but could have mobile functionality added later
        down the line.
    </p>

    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>The story is the user plays as Gil Thunder, an 
        up and coming racer who has made it to the
        Grand Prix, and must defeat their rival, Chad
        Lightning in a race for all the glory.
    </p>

    <h2>Aesthetics</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Graphics</h3>
            <p>I am going for a more retro art style. I
                want the graphics to be reminiscent of 
                8-bit games but with a modern flare.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Sound</h3>
            <p>I want to have a high octane looped background
                racing track, custom made car sounds, and small
                dings for checkpoints like a zone or the finish line.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Mechanics</h3>
            <p>The player can drive around the track attempting to pass
                the finish line before their opponent can. They are also
                in a race against themselves as they try to beat their
                record time in the race.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Controls</h3>
            <p>On desktop, the user will use WASD to drive the car and
                can press `Shift` to boost. For a mobile version, the user
                may drive forward automatically. They can use a left/right
                touch control on the left side of the screen to turn and a 
                boost touch control on the right side to boost.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Teaching the Game</h3>
            <p>There will either be an instructions page where the user can
                see the controls for the game or they will be taught in a
                tutorial that teaches them how to complete a lap on the track.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Player Learning</h3>
            <p>The player must learn how to drive their car, how to optimize
                boost usage, how to take turns optimally, and if there are any
                possible shortcuts within the tracks to defeat a racer who is 
                faster than them.
        </li>
    </ul>
