    <h1>Documentation</h1>
    <h2>Design Process</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>API Project Goal</h3>
            <p>My goal with this project is to create an application that can effectively
                utilize the information available to it in the Dog API to provide users
                with a fun experience to look at dogs, or even with something practical
                like providing help to decide what breed of dog they should look into
                getting.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Audience</h3>
            <p>The audience for my web app is anyone interested in dogs, whether it's
                because they want a new pet, are looking for a cute wallpaper, or even
                because they just want to see cute pictures of dogs.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>How Is My Content Organized?</h3>
            <p>At the top of the page, there is an image of puppies with the title
                "Dog Heaven" laid on top of it. Underneath is a search box with
                drop-down menus to select the breed of dog to look at and the sub-
                breed if there is one, followed by a drop-down menu for how many
                images to load and a button to begin searching for images. Beneath
                that is a section for all of the resulting images to pop up in a grid
                format, with a button above each image to view an enlarged version of
                the image in a new tab. If there are multiple types of dogs in the 
                search results, then the breed and subbreed are displayed over each image.
                If there is only one type of dog, then there is no heading above the images.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><img src="images/website-sketch.png" alt="Design Sketch"></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sources</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><a href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins&display=swap">Poppins
                    Font-Family</a></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/466967055111751523/">Image</a></p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Things to See</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Random Breed: See the different breeds of dogs with titles above each image
                so you know what each breed is.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Corgi Breed: See how when there is a breed with only one sub-breed, the title
                is no longer listed above each dog.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Bulldog Breed: Play with the new drop-down menu to see how the app displays only
                the specified breed. View the english bulldog sub-breed to see how the app responds
                to the api not having enough images to match the requested amount.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How I Met the Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>My app saves information from all changeable search boxes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>My app has 2 search fields, a menu to change how many images are retrieved, and
                buttons to enlarge images.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>My app has custom HTML and CSS, all widgets are labeled, there is enough
                information on the page for users to know what they're doing, any errors are 
                managed appropriately, the state of the app is always apparent, the app is presentable
                on a fullscreen format and on mobile, I use CSS Flexbox and Grid, my html and css validates,
                my JavaScript is stored in a separate file and is well documented.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Overall, I would give myself around a 90% on this project.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
