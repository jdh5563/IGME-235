    <h1>Documentation</h1>
    <h2>Design Process</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Portfolio Goal</h3>
            <p>My current goal with the portfolio is to display the projects I'm most
                proud of so potential employers can see the applications of my skills
                and so friends and family can see what I have accomplished over the years.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Audience</h3>
            <p>The audience for my portfolio is anyone interested in my professional
                work. This can be employers, family, friends, mentors, etc.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Things I Want To Include</h3>
            <p>I would like to include a list of projects that represent my overall
                programming skills, references to other sites (GitHub to see all of
                my projects, LinkedIn to see work experience and skills), a link
                to my resume for an organized list of what I can do, and contact
                information so people can reach out to me.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>How Is My Content Organized?</h3>
            <p>I have large text at the top of the page displaying my name with a
                creative tagline to capture the reader's attention, followed by a
                portrait of myself. In the main body of content, I start with contact
                information and a section of text describing myself and what I like to
                do. Then, I have a list of my projects, with an image/video on the left
                and a brief description on the right with a link attached to the name that
                will take the user either to a page with more details or a playable demo.
                Finally, I have an image of my resume with links to my GitHub and LinkedIn
                next to it. There is also a link to the resume if the user would like to
                download it.
